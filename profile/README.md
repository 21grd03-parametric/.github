## 21GRD03 PaRaMetriC

Welcome to the GitHub page for the Joint Research Project PaRaMetriC.

The aim of the PaRaMetriC project is to develop a comprehensive metrological framework, including standardised figures of merit and testing protocols, to enable the comparable evaluation of the cooling performance of emerging materials exerting passive radiative cooling.

<!---
### Participants
The PaRaMetriC consortium is formed by 9 EURAMET National Metrology Institutes and Designated Insitutes
* Aalto (Finland)
* CMI (Czechia)
* DFM (Denmark)
* INRiM (Italy)
* IO-CSIC (Spain)
* LNE (France)
* PTB (Germany)
* RISE (Sweden)
* UME (Türkiye)

together with 8 additional research institutes, organizations and companies
* Almeco S.p.A. (Italy)
* Center for Applied Energy Research (Germany)
* Comitato termotecnico italiano energia e ambiente CTI (Italy)
* Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (Italy)
* Cooling Photonics (Spain)
* Ethnikó kai Kapodistriakó Panepistímio Athinón (Greece)
